# battletrip
game of battleships with uber @ mhacks6


## game plan
###apps
authorize user’s uber account 
status checks
push notifications for when they hit or went by a ship

###server
keep track of battleship locations
sync with uber api
a user’s final destination
parse cloud code to push notifications
give web app info to render on city hits

###web app
map of hits - is this ethical and would it be allowed? just anonymous data on where people are landing
can put a delay of 1-2 hours on it so it’s not realtime
based off of html5 geolocation for their city
pulls info from server for that city
